Ideas (So don't get too attached to em)

basic bullet: circle (whole notes?) 

Classical
All Three: number of batons increases across stages, "losing" batons (first phase drops it, 2nd and 3rd chucks it at you),  
first phase- shots arrays of bullets in the shape of music notes
transition-Music sheet (bullet pattern is in shape of notes going across music sheet)
second phase and third phase- Points baton at instruments which then shoot bullets in a pattern based off the instrument (examples: trumpet shoots out bullets
in a tight spread at the player so they have to move out of the way whereas the tuba shoots out more but they're more spread out so the player has to dodge and 
weave through the bullets)
transition (same as first but faster)
third phase

EDM
All Three: uses vinyls for bullets, shadow bullets chasing you (1st stage: 1, 2nd: 2, 3rd: 3), spotlight that shoot series of lasers, 
first phase
transition (maybe)
second phase
transition (maybe)
third phase- shoots actual fucking lasers at you with her eyes,

Rock
All three: Guitar riff do send out circular shockwave of bullets, headbanging (tornado and "straight") gets faster the later the phase, audience throwing garbage
(appeasing the crowd to get less thrown at you/do more damage),
first phase
transition (maybe)
second and third phase (Spotlight on you, stay in it and certain special bullets won't effect you)
transition (maybe)
third phase (If there's a long note MOB screams out, it charges up a giant bullet and hurls at you. Think Spirit Bomb)

Stage gets more damaged with each phase (ties in with the songs)



Classical instrument bullet patterns: 
trumpet: after a short delay shoots a tight shotgun like spread that moves rather quickly forcing player to get out fo the way
trombone: after a short delay shoots a wider spread than trumpet and bullets move slower but there is more of them forcing player to dodge and weave through them
tuba: shoots slow moving bullets at the player that get larger in size over time 
bassoon: shoots a somewhat fast bullet at the player every fifth of a second for 5 seconds
violins: shoots out bullets in a wavy pattern for a couple of seconds
horns: shoots a large amount of bullets that are affected by gravity
violas: shoots out bullets in a half wave pattern
flute: shoots out bullets in windy swirl (may be running out of ides)

triangle: shoots out ten waves of bullets in a triangular shape that switch between two formations so the play cant just stand still and dodge it all
