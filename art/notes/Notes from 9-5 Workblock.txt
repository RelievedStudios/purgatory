Stage Layout: The top area of a screen in the main boss area (about 1/8 or 3/16 of the screen) is the stage for the boss to be on for their performance. The rest of the screen is like an audience area where the main character resides. Main character can't go up on the stage, and boss can't come down from the stage.

Classical note: Instead of being in the audience, you're in the orchestra so the Conductor is facing you.
